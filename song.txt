sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

It’s not by sword (or shield) that Jehovah saves,
For the battle is the Lord’s, He will prevail!
Then all our shame will be turned away;
And all the earth will know there’s a God in Israel!

The giant rose and came to fight,
And David hurried, running to the battle line!
He chose a stone from the five in his sack
And slung it quickly at that giant, just in time!
